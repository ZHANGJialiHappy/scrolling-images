# scrolling-images

## Inspired by

[`Timeframe App`](https://timeframe-app.webflow.io/)

## Stack

1. TypeScript
2. Vite
3. React
4. Tailwind CSS
5. DaisyUI
6. Framer motion

## Demo

Check my application on [`gh-pages`](https://zhangjialihappy.github.io/scrolling-images/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you should run `npm install` first.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/] to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

That will cause the `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts defined in `package.json` to run.\
Under the hood, the `predeploy` script will build a distributable version of the Vite/React app and store it in a folder named `build`. Then, the `deploy` script will push the contents of that folder to a new commit on the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository, creating that branch if it doesn't already exist.
